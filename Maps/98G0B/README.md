# Custom Maps
There are 5 maps in here

None of these maps are tested as I use the 9E60B DME. If you use this and it works, shoot a PM or create an issue and I'll edit these accordingly

Flames - Only difference is timing retardation at high RPM and low load
Flame2 - Same as above but runs a bit richer at high RPM and low load

1. 98G0B_STOCK > Self Explanitory
2. 98G0B_STOCK - Flame > Stock mapping with flames at ~5k RPM (Untested)
3. 98G0B_STOCK - Flame2 > Same as above but with a -0.589 change in the fuel tables from 20-30 load and 5k-7k RPM. (Untested)
4. 9E60B_PUMP - Flame > BMS PUMP BEF map with Flames (Untested, only use with JB4!)
5. 9E60B_PUMP - Flame2 > Same as above but with a -0.589 change in the fuel tables from 20-30 load and 5k-7k RPM.

Use at your own risk! Flame tunes can really fuck ur shit up. I have had metal shavings come out my exhaust in a video I took so take that into consideration. Don't be upset if you blow ur turbo or melt ur cats
Do not, ever, run these tunes without catless DPs or DP cutouts, you will melt your cats
