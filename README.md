# N55e-CustomMaps
Some custom maps I have made
All maps are for the 9E60B, I have only tested the PUMP2 - Flames map as I have a JB4 and repurposed the BEF.

Flames were followed from this guide: https://www.e90post.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1358084

Timing isn't majorly changed until 5k RPM, because N55 doesn't have fuel cutoff tables, standing flames aren't super impressive, but WOT pulls are.
I have only tested the PUMP2 map I have made.
General Notes:
* Only tested with a 14psi limit, could probably go to 19psi
* MINIMUM catless downpipes required, good idea to have a catback as well.
* Use all of these at your own risk, what works for me may not work for your
* You can use these maps with MHD burble, just don't set the max RPM higher than ~4500rpm
