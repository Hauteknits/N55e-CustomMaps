# N55e-CustomMaps
Some custom maps I have made as well as continued development on the public BMW N55 XDF, working on merging into dmacpro91's repo

Flames were followed from this guide: https://www.e90post.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1358084
Semi-frequent updates posted there as well

Timing isn't majorly changed until 5k RPM, because N55 doesn't have fuel cutoff tables, standing flames aren't super impressive, but WOT pulls are.
I have only tested the PUMP2 map I have made.
General Notes:
* Tested up to 22psi
* MINIMUM catless downpipes required, good idea to have a catback as well.
* Use all of these at **your own risk**, what works for me may not work for your
* You can use these maps with MHD burble, just don't set the max RPM higher than ~4500rpm

Information for the WOTBox compatibility can be found in the XDFs folder
