# Custom Maps
There are 3 maps in here
1. 9E60B_STOCK > Self Explanitory
2. 9E60B_STOCK - Flames > Stock mapping with flames at ~5k RPM (Untested, but should be fine)
3. 9E60B_PUMP2 - Flames(Tested) > BMS PUMP2 BEF map with Flames (Tested, only use with JB4!)
4. 9E60B_PUMP2 - Flames(Testing, AFR Mod) > Same as above but with a -0.589 change in the fuel tables from 20-30 load and 5k-7k RPM. Some basic tests seem to produce good results, not sure how the long term effects will be, but nothing immediatly catostrophic
